## Game Rules

Azul is a tile-laying game where players compete to create the most beautiful wall. The game consists of:

1. **Factory Phase**: Players draft tiles from factories or the center
2. **Wall-tiling Phase**: Complete pattern lines are moved to the wall
3. **Scoring**: Points are awarded based on tile placement patterns

### Scoring

- **Tile Placement**: 1-5+ points based on adjacent tiles
- **End Game Bonuses**:
  - Complete horizontal row: 2 points
  - Complete vertical column: 7 points
  - Complete color set: 10 points

## AI Strategies

The game includes three AI personalities:

- **Greedy**: Focuses on immediate tile collection and line completion
- **Defensive**: Prioritizes avoiding penalties and blocking opponents
- **Wall-focused**: Emphasizes long-term wall pattern building
